COMMON ISSUES FROM HW

- whether to use single or double quotes:
    -either as long as consistent
    -single is refering to name of something (strings)

- histogram binning:
    x = np.linspace(-5 * np.pi, 5 * np.pi, 1000)
    -must provide series of breaks
    -linearly spaced set of numbers from negative 5 to 5 and 1000 breaks
    -would give 1001 bins

for my hw I could have done ax.bar(whatever.index, whatever.values) 
    - if this made a new datafram of months w/ stuff and an unnamed flow column

if it kept flow named, could do whatever.flow instead of whatevr.values

to create it with [flow] only one brackets
    -call with whatever.index, whatever.values... cause no column header



for my describe issue:
    if i did:
        flow_by_month=data_frame.groupby(["month"])[["flow"]].describe()
    there are several header columns so cant call [max]
    instead could call with both column names
        flow_by_month['flow', 'max']      or    ['flow']['max']

OR could drop level to get rid of first part

then could do:
    ax.bar(flow_by_month.index, flow_by_month['max'])
