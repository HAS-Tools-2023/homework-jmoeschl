1/3: Good effort to try to get some stuff done on your own. Please come see me in office hours and I would be happy to walk through this with you. Also try to make sure next time you can come to my office hours before its due so that I can help you in advance. I've tried to get office hours scheduled now so that people have time to get help in advance.

I got lost for the last 20 minutes of class when we went over this.  The part that really throws me off is the 'test' that kept being used.  I am unsure of what that does.  I also do not know how to use it.  Further, I did not understand the naming used so trying to replicate it this week was difficult.  I wrote down having used 'year month' day' but the starter code deleted those terms so I cannot figure out how to recall those values other than 'flow_dat[:0]'.  Further, my code is broken again for whatever reason trying to read the file and it does this frequently until it finds a sensitive happy spot.  Since it was not working, I was not able to run anything.  I did try and do each question separate of the class guidance though to what made sense to me.  For loops I desperately want to get a hold on and I think I have the general idea.  The only concern is my syntax is still struggling becasue I get lost in all of the other syntax I am unfamiliar with inside of it (such as the test).

I have no values from this code that were able to be outputted.
