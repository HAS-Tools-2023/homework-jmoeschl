3/3 - Great work this semester! I'm really glad there were some parts you liked and that you liked the approach of this last weeks class. Being able to piggy back of other peoples codes is a great place to be after just one semester of class on this. My advice to you is to just keep coding as much as possible and you will be amazed how quickly you progress from here. 

### Question 1
My favorite topic was the geopandas and maps like ArcGIS.  ALthough it is probably less useful than ArcGIS, the manipulation of the frames was incredibly fun.  Most useful data was the API's and pulling straight from a website because it limited possible errors running a code due to file path errors.

### Question 2
I don't know other things can be done through coding, but maybe for API's how to know if a website is able to be pulled apart in that way.

### Question 3
I think I have progressed in that I could create a simple code if I had something to piggy back off of or guidance through it.  I do not think I have progressed to a point of being able to open a blank file and get a code to do whatever it is I need it to do.  I did succeed though in seeing a lot of different things.

### Question 4
I think this past week's exercise was the most useful for me so to do more things like that.  The step by step and explanation behind each small bit of code we would write helped a lot.  I have always been a person to get lost in a big chunk of letters and such on a screen though, so just for my learning style I think it helped the most.
