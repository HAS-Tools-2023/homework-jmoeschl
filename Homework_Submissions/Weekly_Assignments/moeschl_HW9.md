### Homework 9

### Grade 7.75/9
**Code Review**
- I left comments in your code with some suggestions they all start with #LC
- Hopefully my comments will clear up some of your confusion noted below.  
Readability: 2.75/3 
    - I like the way you broke up your code into sections. 
    - Some of your variable names are a bit confusing though. Try to have variable names that more directly describe what they are calculating. 
    - Could use some additional comments throughout to explain what is going on in more detail. Your short headings were not always enough to understand what you were doing. good. 
Style: 2.75/3
    - mostly good but check the linter for comments on white space 
  - 
Code:  2.25/3
    - Nice work your code ran perfectly for me!
    - I took of 0.5 because your function wasn't working I showed you in the comments how to fix it. 
    - I took of 0.25 since you didn't have timeseries functionality working

### FORECAST GENERATION

This week, I still chose to base my values a bit off of looking at current conditions, but this past weeks script was able to run a value close enough to the true value that it can almost be used in evaluation.

### SCRIPT UPDATES

I added slight comments to my code to remind myself what each graph in the multi panel represented.  My variables I already named by what they defined because it helps me follow my thought process when reading it again.

### FUNCTION

My function goal was to get the average flow per month because I am still confused on what a function is doing and I was able to just copy and redo the example from class with a slightly different statistic.  The average will also be most helpful this month I imagine.  


### CONFUSION

I have a lot of confusions still and continue to be one week behind.  This week, I finally got the time series to not produce errors for me so that was cool.  I am not sure how to convert my current code to that format though.  I have another code version of this homeowrk witha  bunch of questions on it pertaining to that.  Particularly getting my october_data dataframe to come from a time series.  For this weeks functions, I do not really understand still the what or why that the inside of the function is doing and why none of the variables used are from outside of it.  My code is also broken from what was used in class.  I copied and pasted it and for the monthly_max, it outputs "nan" and same for my own function of the average.  I cannot get a value.  I did do "dropnan()" prior.
