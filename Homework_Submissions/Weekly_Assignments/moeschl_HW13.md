### Homework 13

### Grade:
7.5/9:
Overall really nice work. No worries if functions are still confusing it is definitely a lot to wrap your head around.  Also ChatGPT scares me  bit too :) Its totally up to you whether you want to use it or not. I don't actually use it very much in my day to day work either, but its an important tool so I just want to be sure you are all aware of it and can use it or not however makes the most sense to you. 

I subtracted: 
-  0.5 because your streamflow reading function wasn't working so I couldn't see the data
-  1 because the forecast date that gets set at the top doesn't actually adjust the streamflow forecast because the reading functions are hard coded to a set date range. 

I left you some comments in your code to give you some pointers on how to address these issues just for future reference. 

### Reflection
I changed my code to get rid of the graphs from the last graded script for the most part.  I focused more on the directly being asked parts to keep my code less cluttered.  i added the APIs and functions.  I think my code really needs help witht he functions and knowing what to use them for and what calculations to do for a streamflow forecast.  I also do not get much of how to strongly use the forecast number at the top.  Looking at the codes created for forecast judging, it makes sens ebut I cannot wrap my head around using it myself.

ChaptGPT I have never used until today actually.  I made a point not to so that is also a part stressing my brain as I really do not know how to use it as most people do and what it produces terrifies me.  I am trying ti figure that out though so what I did was ask it to write me a function and used it to compare mine that I already had and tried to make adjustments off of it.  I really need practice using it though.
