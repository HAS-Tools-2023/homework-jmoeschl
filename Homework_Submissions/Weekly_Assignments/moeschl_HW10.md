## What I Learned:
I understood generally how matplotlib was used to creat graphs on tuesdays assignment.  I also understood how to read in a file with inclusion of the datetime part.  I felt way mroe comfortable with thursday's exercises though and those I was able to do mostly on my own from scratch (not building off answers in class).  I am completely lost on how to work functions though as well as the for loops in vs. out the function.


## What I Am Confused On:
1) 
From Tuesday's assignment, I am confused on what 

"iris_type='versicolor'
ax.scatter(iris_df.loc[iris_type]['sepal length (cm)']"

is doing.  I get that it is pulling the type in row one.  In row two thoug, why can't "iris_type" stand alone if it was defined in the row above?  Why is .loc[] still needed?

2) 
I do not get the difference between setting index vs. parse dates.  I also do not get the reading in a csv vs. a table besides that there is no "sep=" part.

3)
The code is broken in 2.4 for the average but works for the min and max.  i also do not know how to set x and y axis within the single line or the title.  I could get it separately added though.  Just the average was a lost cause wehn operating the same way as min and max.

4)
I also had a further question about one answer we went thorugh in class.  For each plot, do you need to start with "fig, ax = plt.subplots()"?
